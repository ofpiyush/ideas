## Climate change

### Onboarding with actionable items for climate change

#### Motivation

It can be daunting to learn about climate change and figure what's the best way one can contribute with the skills one has.

New user experience to the entire movement is very unclear and overwhelming. Most of the information is either scary info dump or skeptic pieces. 

Given there is nothing actionable for quite a while and realising what actions one can take is cumbersome, partly-hidden and heavily-debated, most people would drop off before they can figure how they can help.

#### Solution

Ask people about themselves and give them a semi-personalised, 1 step at a time, actionable onboarding.

Make the initial few weeks of their journey into reversing climate change guided, keep giving progressively difficult things to do.

Note: I used a bot builder because it gets the point across quicker, the UI definitely should not be a bot.

### Social credits to bridge social and economic incentives short term

#### Motivation

Most people can't / aren't going to give a shit about something that will happen 5-10 years from now. We need to bridge rewards for them short term to do the right thing.

#### Solution

Make a social credits system to give short term incentives to people to reduce their environmental footprint.
Use this to create social and economic pressure on govt and industry to improve their impact on climate.

- People earn points based on how far below the national average per capita emission they are.
- Company A sells coffee, it wants to be seen as caring about the environment. They have a marketing budget.
- Company A offers a 10% discount on their coffee for people in exchange of 100 points.
